<div class="wordwrap">I am learning mandarin these days. I was thinking of ways to force myself to construct mandarin sentences. So I decided to write this section in mandarin. I try to write five new sentences every day. This forces me to use the words and structure that I have learned so far into coherent senstences. In case I try to talk to a Chinese person and they ask something about me, I have got myself covered.</div>
