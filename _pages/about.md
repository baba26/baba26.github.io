About this website.
======
Hi there. I am physics grad student. I spend most of my time reading physics and math concepts. Sometimes I wish I had a place where I could share what I learned. Hopefully this website will be that place. I intend to write some blogs here to summarize my learnings. Please feel free to point out my mistakes, or ask for clarifications if my explanations are not clear

For more info
------
This is where I am supposed to share my email. But let's not be too hasty. Let me write a few blogs first.
